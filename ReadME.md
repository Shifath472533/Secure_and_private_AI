### Day 37: August 2
- Running and understanding the notebook of 3 of fastai nlp, corresponding to video 4,5. my edited notebook https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lFdr-Zi386sAjUYIXCmniReJnh56bH9A. Stuck at the last part.
- Watching video 6

### Day 36:
Conducted a 3 hour long workshop on introductory machine learning. Github repo for the same can be found here ->> https://github.com/tanny411/ML-Workshop. It was a good experience being the teacher instead of the student. It was quite a warmup for myself even. Spend the morning till before the workshop preparing for it, just to make sure no one freaks out about deep learning.
Thanks to my friends and my institution for making this possible!

Got amazing encouragements today. Id like to encourage some amazing ladies @Helena Barmer @Shubhangi Jena @Labiba @SusanW @Joyce Obi

### Day 28:
Started my notebook for 'manipualting pandas dataframe'. https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oL5PNbA9ZOakTEr3mkXuJ-V5owIrJjMR anyone can take help from it as a quick brushup on pandas.
My other notebooks are available here https://github.com/tanny411/Data-Camp/tree/master/Datascience%20with%20Python%20career%20track
encouraging @SusanW @par @Labiba @Md. Mahedi Hasan Riday @Nazmul @Shudipto Trafder @Dharmendra Choudhary

### Day 27:
finally finished phase 1 of language modeling and text classification and did some visualization
finishing up datacamps dataframe manipulation course.

### Day 26: 
running my model for text classification with deep learning.
started next chapter for datacamp pandas dataframe manipulation course.

### Day 25: 
didnt do much. Been sick. Just one chapter of manipulation pandas dataframe.

### DAY 23:
1. Video 2 of fastai nlp. alongwith related resources mentioned in the video. can already feel #sg_deepdive-nlp is going to be super useful :heart:
2. Finally finished Datacamps pandas Foundation. It was quite involving, i need to revise again. My cert https://www.datacamp.com/statement-of-accomplishment/course/2ab94bcd08b5312a6b7ac801ebab828253a39061
I will encourage @Joyce Obi @SusanW @Anna Scott @par

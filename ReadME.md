I would like to encourage @SusanW @Shudipto Trafder @Nazmul @Md. Mahedi Hasan Riday @Frida 

Day 29:
1. started learning transformers. running a model with transformer using fastai for text classification.
2. finished datacamp course, manipulating pandas dataframe. cert https://www.datacamp.com/statement-of-accomplishment/course/3172ae542359868a51a6ed6c8fd53b14e9d2543c. It was quite a challenging course. Collected and practiced all lessons in this notebook https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oL5PNbA9ZOakTEr3mkXuJ-V5owIrJjMR. Will need frequent revision.

encouraging @SusanW @par @Labiba @Md. Mahedi Hasan Riday @Nazmul @Shudipto Trafder @Dharmendra Choudhary

Day 27:
finally finished phase 1 of language modeling and text classification and did some visualization
finishing up datacamps dataframe manipulation course.

Day 26: running my model for text classification with deep learning.
started next chapter for datacamp pandas dataframe manipulation course.

Day 25: didnt do much. Been sick. Just one chapter of manipulation pandas dataframe.

DAY 22:
1. Video 2 of fastai nlp. alongwith related resources mentioned in the video. can already feel #sg_deepdive-nlp is going to be super useful :heart:
2. Finally finished Datacamps pandas Foundation. It was quite involving, i need to revise again. My cert https://www.datacamp.com/statement-of-accomplishment/course/2ab94bcd08b5312a6b7ac801ebab828253a39061
I will encourage @Joyce Obi @SusanW @Anna Scott @par

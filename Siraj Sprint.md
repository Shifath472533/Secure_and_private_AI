## Natural Language Processing:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDxFvr1gpSU
- From text we extract 3 things: syntax, semantics, pragmatics(context).
- Alan Turing paper : Computing Machinery and Intelligence
- Noam Chomsky Book : Syntactic structure. From here comes rule based systems in NLP.
- 1980s NLP in ML started. e.g decision trees = automatically learned if-else rules?
- Now? Deep!! 2019?! Transfer Learning!
- BERT a Language Model(Pretrained) SOTA in *11* NLP tasks. It is a transformer model.
- Talks about why language model over word2vec.
- TRANSFORMER: a newer type of NN >> all Recurrent networks. Dont use recurrents. They use *attention*.
- text classification and **extractive summarization** : https://github.com/llSourcell/bert-as-service

## Sentiment Analysis/Opinion Mining
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Pzni2yfGUQ
- Direct Opinion vs Comparative opinion.
- Explicit (good) vs implicit (heavy implies weight) opinion.
- We can perform sentiment analysis in document level, sentence level or even sub-sentence level.
- Two ways: 
	- Rule based. From a dictionary of + or - words. https://github.com/llSourcell/Sentiment_Analysis
	- NN. e.g Scikitlearn

## Privacy in DS

- GDPR : set of laws protecting the EU citizens.
- **Everything about you is DATA**
- https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/tree/master/examples/tutorials
- Federated Learning: Users generate data. It brings the model to the training data. But we can . reverse engineer the learnt weights and learn about user data :o
- Secure Multparty Computation: Solves the above mentioned problem. Data partitioned and encrypted. Computations possible in encrypted state. 
- Differencial privacy: Makes sure a model learns only what its supposed to learn without accidentally learning private info from a dataset. Its a promise of the data scientist to the data owner.

### How to ML?
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waXHrc2m9K8
- Lead A a healthy life. Self talk. Stop automated negative thoughts. You are NOT too old/unsmart/blah blah...
- So many reources, no excuses please!!
- Peer GROUP! Classmates, Slacks.
- Exercise! Good for heart? Good for brain!
- Eat healthy. You know why!
- Good nights rest is a MUST.
- Information overload is a real thing. Isolate from internet for sometime. Continuous 24 hour a week disconnet.
- Optimize learning environment. A designated place to study!(We know this from habit forming books)

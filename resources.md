### Swapnil Gaikwad 10:17 PM
Facebook AI has developed a new approach to compress neural networks by quantizing their weights, while maintaining a short inference time in particular for computer vision problems. With their method they can compress a ResNet-50 model on ImageNet to 5mb (20x compression factor) from usually 100mb while preserving the top-1 accuracy (76.1 percent).
